# android-pairing-api
This API uses Ktor, can check the [Quick start!](https://ktor.io/quickstart/)

## You will use this API to:
* List guide shops
* Get a specific guide shop
* Post a new guide shop
* Update a new guide shop
* Delete a guide shop

All you have to do is run the `main` method on the Application.kt, then the API will be listening on localhost:8080.

#### This isn't a boilerplate for your android test, it's just an API to consume data.
